#+TITLE: Design Notes

* Deployment
** Initial deployment

Currently deployed as a simple opam package.
Assuming opam is installed an initialized, a fresh instance can be deployed as
follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone https://github.com/shonfeder/shonfeder_net.git
cd shonfeder_net
opam switch create . # ocaml-base-compiler.4.08.1
shonfeder_net
#+END_SRC

This will start the server running on the default port =3000=.

** As a systemd service
On my "production" VPS, the server is run as a systemd unit, defined in
=/etc/systemd/system/shonfeder_net.service=.

- To start/stop the service :: =sudo systemctl (start|stop) shonfeder_net=
- To enable/disable the service :: =sudo systemctl (enable|disable) shonfeder_net.service=

** Caddy reverse proxy

[[https://caddyserver.com/][Caddy]] server is run as a reverse proxy, providing TLS certification and caching.
To start, caddy is installed using apt.

Caddy is managev by systemd, according to the unit file is located
=lib/systemd/system/caddy.service=.

*** It is necessary to download or build a version of caddy that has the cache module enabled

- Install xcaddy :: https://github.com/caddyserver/xcaddy?tab=readme-ov-file#install
- Build caddy with cache support ::
  #+begin_src sh
  xcaddy build $CURRENT_CADDY_VERSION --with github.com/caddyserver/cache-handler
  #+end_src
- Do a package divert so the custom build will work alongside the other
  installed caddy functions ::
  https://caddyserver.com/docs/build#package-support-files-for-custom-builds-for-debianubunturaspbian

Alternatively, we could have built and hosted a binary.

*** The configuration of caddy is via the Caddyfile

The caddy file should be moved to =/etc/caddy/Caddyfile=

** Updating

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cd ~/shonfeder_net
git pull
opam install .
sudo systemctl restart shonfeder_net
#+END_SRC

https://github.com/ocsigen/ocsigenserver/pull/238
*** DONE Set up https
*** DONE Set up caching
*** TODO Migrate to serving in a mirage unikernal
*** TODO Move to org-mode for content?
** Deployment
*** DONE Deploy
*** TODO Set up ci/cd so new updates to source are propagated to server automatically
**** Monitor remote repo
**** On changes to source, pull
**** Install systemd service
**** If change is in =./site= dir, finished
**** Otherwise rebuild and restart
- =opam install .=
- =sudo systemctl restart shonfeder_net.service=
*** TODO Document
*** TODO Set up DNS routing
