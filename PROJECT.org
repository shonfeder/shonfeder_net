#+TITLE: Design Notes

* Deployment
** Initial deployment

Currently deployed as a simple opam package.
Assuming opam is installed an initialized, a fresh instance can be deployed as
follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone https://github.com/shonfeder/shonfeder_net.git
cd shonfeder_net
opam switch create . # ocaml-base-compiler.4.08.1
shonfeder_net
#+END_SRC

This will start the server running on the default port =3000=.

** As a systemd service
On my "production" VPS, the server is run as a systemd unit, defined in
=/etc/systemd/system/shonfeder_net.service=.

- To start/stop the service :: =sudo systemctl (start|stop) shonfeder_net=
- To enable/disable the service :: =sudo systemctl (enable|disable) shonfeder_net.service=

** Updating
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cd ~/shonfeder_net
git pull
#+END_SRC

If only static content has been updated, you're done. Otherwise

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
opam install .
sudo systemctl restart shonfeder_net.service
#+END_SRC

*** TODO Set up HTTPS
*** TODO Migrate to serving in a mirage unikernal
** Deployment
*** DONE Deploy
*** TODO Set up ocurrent pipeline to automate deployment when repo changes
*** TODO Set up ci/cd so new updates to source are propagated to server automatically
**** Monitor remote repo
**** On changes to source, pull
**** If change is in =./site= dir, finished
**** Otherwise rebuild and restart
- =opam intall .=
- =sudo systemctl restart shonfeder_net.service=
*** TODO Document
*** TODO Set up DNS routing
