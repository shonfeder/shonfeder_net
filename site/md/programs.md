# Unpublished | WIP

## [ND Project](https://github.com/shonfeder/nd_project): A pedagogical web toy for learning Gentzenâ€™s natural deduction

- Fullstack, reactive OCaml using [`Opium`](https://github.com/rgrinberg/opium),
  [`Js_of_ocaml`](https://github.com/ocsigen/js_of_ocaml), and
  [`incr_dom`](https://github.com/janestreet/incr_dom).

## [These](https://github.com/shonfeder/these): A Type for inclusive disjunction

- An OCaml port of Haskell's
  [Data.These](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/these-1.0.1/docs/Data-These.html)

- [COBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_Overhead_Byte_Stuffing) is "a
  framing method for binary streams and is useful any time you need to send
  binary datagrams over a stream interface" - Inspired by
  [nim_cobs](https://github.com/keyme/nim_cobs)
- My property based testing for this implementation revealed a bug in `nim_cobs`.
