I [work as a software engineer](/resume) at [Tarides](https://tarides.com/) and
I study [programming](/programs) and [philosophy](/posts).

I approach my work from the perspectives of [programming language
theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language_theory), [critical
theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_theory), and [communication
theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_theory). With an academic
background in philosophy and literary theory and years of industry experience, I
aim to articulate coherent designs and evolve correct implementations that are
responsive to our communities' needs. I pursue a methodology combining
[systematic analysis][systematic analysis],
[algebraic semiotics][algebraic semiotics],
[compassionate communication][compassionate communication],
and [participatory design][participatory design].

If you are a kindred spirit, I'd be happy to hear from you!
