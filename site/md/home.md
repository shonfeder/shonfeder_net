I study [programming](/programs) and [philosophy](/posts) and [work as a
software engineer](/resume) at [informal.systems](https://informal.systems/).

Guided by concern for the well being of the disadvantaged and for humanity's
future, I work at applying what I can learn in my studies to benefit those in
need of care.

I approach programming from the perspective of [Programming Language
Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language_theory). Leveraging
my training in philosophy and literary theory, I evolve coherent designs
responsive to user's genuine needs. My methodology combines systematic analysis
and type-driven modeling of the problem domain together with compassionate
communication and participatory design. In my years of experience as a software
engineer, I have learned to implement, document, and deploy the resulting
programs reliably and efficiently.

If you are a kindred spirit, I'd be happy to hear from you!
