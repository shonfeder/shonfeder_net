Here I list some activities and artifacts that I've pursued to connect with and
contribute to communities.

# Writing | Study

## [Synechepedia](https://shonfeder.github.io/index.html): A digital (sketch|scrap|note)book

Ongoing and incompletable.

- Drawing connections, fumbling for expression, taking note 
- Full of rough drafts, works in progress, and evocative snippets I've read

# Community

## [opam Repository Maintainer](https://ocaml.org/governance/packaging): Socio-technical custodian

2024 to present.

- Helping maintain the infrastructure and processes that sustain the [opam
  package repository](https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository).

## [OCaml Outreachy Co-Mentor](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/announcing-our-new-outreachy-interns/8932): Technical mentorship

Winter of 2022.

- Supported and tutored mentees in learning OCaml.
- Supported mentees in learning how to contribute to OSS communities, how to
  approach software design and implementation.
- Provided career guidance and mentorship.

## [ICFP 2020 OCaml Workshop Organizing Committee Member](https://icfp20.sigplan.org/home/ocaml-2020): Supporting the research community

2020.

- I volunteered for the organizing committee for the 2020 ICFP OCaml Workshop.
  I helped transcribe video presentations in the service of accessibility and
  assisted in facilitating talks.

## [Coding Made Easy at IS 62 K (Ditmas)](https://www.newyorkcares.org/projects/coding-made-easy-62-k-ditmas-7): Education in programmatic literacy

2016.

- A [New York Cares](https://www.newyorkcares.org/) project partnered with the
after-school program at Ditmas Junior High.
- Over 14 weeks, we supported students exploring basic programming
concepts, techniques, and technologies
- I helped launch this project as a Volunteer Team Leader, coordinating the
volunteers, tailoring the curriculum to the needs of each student, and providing
hands-on instruction and support in the classroom on a weekly basis.

## [/r/prolog](https://www.reddit.com/r/prolog): The logic programming subreddit

Sometime in the 2010s.

- Moderator and contributor for more than 6 years

## [/r/futurebeats](https://old.reddit.com/r/futurebeats): Omnigeneric haven for experimental beat music

Some times in the 2000s to 2010s.

- I founded the subreddit, established its core ethos and norms, and recruited
  the initial team of moderators. I was heavily involved in supporting and
  nurturing the community for several years. A group of active and talented
  moderators and contributors have built up a small, but vibrant online
  ecosystem with this subreddit at its center. It is currently home to a
  community of over 170k subscribers and something like a musical genera has
  formed with this community near to its center.
- I have not been involved for years, but I still love bass music and
  experimental beat-heavy stuff, among all kinds of other things. You can find
  traces of the music I like and even some ancient things I made on [my
  SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/abathologist).
